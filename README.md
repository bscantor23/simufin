## 🔧 Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
>>>>>>> refs/remotes/origin/main
- npm or yarn
- Docker (optional)

### Local Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/bscantor23/simufin.git
cd simufin

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run in development mode
npm run dev

# Open in browser

## Usage Guide

### 1. Loan Configuration
- **Amount**: Initial loan capital
- **Interest Rate**: Numeric value of the rate
- **Rate Type**: Nominal or Effective
- **Rate Frequency**: Annual, Semiannual, Bimonthly, Monthly
- **Modality**: Ordinary or Due
- **Number of Periods**: Loan duration
- **Calculation Type**: Amortization or Capitalization

### 2. Results Visualization
- **Interactive Charts**: Hover to see specific details
- **Detailed Table**: Expand to view all periods
- **Calculations Panel**: Step-by-step mathematical explanations

### 3. Data Interpretation
- **Amortization**: Gradual repayment of the borrowed capital
- **Capitalization**: Accumulation of interest on the capital
- **Period 0**: Initial state before the first payment
- **Totals**: Sum of all payments made

## Implemented Formulas

### Periodic Payment
- **Ordinary Amortization**: `C = [S × i × (1 + i)^n] / [(1 + i)^n - 1]`
- **Due Amortization**: `C = [S × i × (1 + i)^n] / [(1 + i)^n - 1] / (1 + i)`
- **Ordinary Capitalization**: `C = [S × i] / [(1 + i)^n - 1]`
- **Due Capitalization**: `C = [S × i] / [(1 + i)^n - 1] / (1 + i)`

### Rate Conversion
- **Nominal to Effective**: `i_effective = (1 + i_nominal/m)^m - 1`
- **Effective to Nominal**: `i_nominal = m × [(1 + i_effective)^(1/m) - 1]`
- **Frequency Change**: `i_new = (1 + i_current)^(f_new/f_current) - 1`

## Technical Features

### Smart Responsiveness
- **Desktop**: Footer fixed at the bottom of the screen
- **Mobile/Tablet**: Footer after content to avoid overlap
- **Automatic Detection**: Dynamic calculation of available space

### Performance Optimization
